# STM32 HAL Drivers for interfacing with various components

Since one can struggle a bit finding drivers for the STM32 microcontrollers, I've decided to start sharing whatever written drivers I found
laying around in the past projects I've done and will do. If you are willing to contribute feel free to make a pull request and I'll take a look at it.


You can find more information about the prerequisites and setup necessary about each driver in the <drivername>.h file


Added so far:
- Single data line neopixel driver (only RGB channels supported at the moment)

To be added in the near future:
- SHT30 I2C temperature and humidity sensor driver
- Winbond SPI Flash driver
