# STM32 HAL Drivers for interfacing with various components

Since one can struggle a bit finding drivers for the STM32 microcontrollers, I've decided to start sharing whatever drivers I found
laying around in the past projects, and will share the future drivers. If you are willing to contribute feel free to do so :)


You can find more information about the prerequisites and setup necessary about each driver in the <drivername>.h file


Added so far:
- Single data line neopixel driver (only RGB channels supported at the moment)
- SHT30 I2C temperature and humidity sensor driver

To be added in the near future:
- Winbond SPI Flash driver
